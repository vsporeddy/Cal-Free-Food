*Job Description*: You will define roadmaps to meet requirements, goals and 
milestones for a new technology process. Defines and establishes flow, 
procedures, and equipment configuration for the module. Selects and 
develops material and equipment for the process to meet quality, 
reliability, cost, yield, productivity and manufacture requirements. Plans 
and conducts experiments to fully characterize the process throughout the 
development cycle. Drives improvements on quality, reliability, cost, 
yield, process stability/capability, productivity and safety/ergonomic over 
variables such as material, method, equipment, environment and operating 
personnel. Develops solutions to problems utilizing formal education, 
statistical knowledge, and problem-solving tools. Establishes process 
control systems for the process module and sustains the module through 
volume ramp. Develops strategy to resolve difficult problems and 
establishes systems to deal with these problems in the future. Trains 
production/receiving process engineers for transfer to other factories. 
Transfers process to high volume manufacturing and provide support in new 
factory start-up as well as install and qualification of the new production 
lines.
